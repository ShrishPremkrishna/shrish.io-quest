            The Acromantula is carnivorous and prefers large prey. 
            It spins domeshaped webs upon the ground. 
            The female is bigger than the male and may lay up to one hundred eggs at a time. 
            Soft and white, these are as large as beach balls. 
            The young hatch in six to eight weeks.
            Acromantula eggs are defined as Class A NonTradeable Goods by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, 
            meaning that severe penalties are attached to their importation or sale.
        </p>

        <p>This beast is believed to be wizard-bred, possibly intended to guard wizard dwellings or treasure, 
            as is often the case with magically created monsters.
        </p>

        <p> Despite its near-human intelligence, the Acromantula is untrainable and highly dangerous to wizard and Muggle alike.
            Rumours that a colony of Acromantula has been established in Scotland are unconfirmed 
            (Confirmed in 1992 by Harry James Potter and Ronald Billius Weasley).
